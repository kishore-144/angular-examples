## Project Overview
This Angular project is designed as a comprehensive hands-on exercise to quickly reinforce and practice essential Angular concepts. It provides a structured environment to experiment with core features, including component interaction, forms, reactive programming, routing, HTTP requests, and state management. The goal is to accelerate learning by offering practical examples that cover both fundamental and intermediate Angular topics.

The project is ideal for developers who want to **refresh Angular knowledge**, prepare for interviews, or gain confidence in building real-world applications with Angular’s modern best practices.

## Key Features

### Component Architecture
- Demonstrates the creation of standalone and nested components.
- Shows parent-child communication using `@Input` and `@Output`.
- Uses `EventEmitter` to handle data flow between components efficiently.

### Routing and Navigation
- Implements Angular Router for multi-page navigation.
- Uses `routerLink` and `routerLinkActive` for dynamic link highlighting.
- Handles exact and partial route matching, including nested routes.

### Forms
- Covers **Template-driven forms** using `ngModel`.
- Covers **Reactive forms** using `FormControl` and `FormGroup`.
- Implements form validation, required fields, and dynamic form control updates.
- Demonstrates capturing form submissions and preserving submitted data.

### HTTP Client Integration
- Connects to a mock REST API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) to perform CRUD operations.
- Handles GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using Angular `HttpClient`.
- Demonstrates proper request handling and response processing.

### State Management
- Uses signals and local state for reactive UI updates.
- Demonstrates how to store last submitted data and maintain UI consistency.

### Event Handling and Lifecycle Hooks
- Showcases Angular lifecycle hooks like `ngOnInit`, `ngAfterViewInit`, `ngDoCheck`, and `ngOnDestroy`.
- Demonstrates how component initialization, updates, and destruction can be tracked and managed.

### Styling and Dynamic Classes
- Practical examples of CSS class binding, inline styles, and dynamic animations.
- Implements conditional styling based on component state.
